#it states the son of whoeverthefrick is standing on top of the base and the base to the guy he wants to shoot is 360 meters sooooooooo ya
frombasetodeadguy = 360 #meters

#no air resistants because the arrows come from buttfuck nowhere


#whatever the arrows height at max thing add arrow_shot_height variable to it
